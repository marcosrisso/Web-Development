    <article>
      <p>
Swift is a new programming language for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development.
Nonetheless, many parts of Swift will be familiar from your experience of developing in C and Objective-C.
      </p>

      <p>
Swift provides its own versions of all fundamental C and Objective-C types, including Int for integers, Double and Float for floating-point values, Bool for Boolean values, and String for textual data.
Swift also provides powerful versions of the three primary collection types, Array, Set, and Dictionary, as described in Collection Types.
      </p>
<p>Like C, Swift uses variables to store and refer to values by an identifying name.
  Swift also makes extensive use of variables whose values can‚Äôt be changed. These are known as constants, and are much more powerful than constants in C.
  Constants are used throughout Swift to make code safer and clearer in intent when you work with values that don‚Äôt need to change.</p>
  <p>
    In addition to familiar types, Swift introduces advanced types not found in Objective-C, such as tuples.
    Tuples enable you to create and pass around groupings of values.
    You can use a tuple to return multiple values from a function as a single compound value.
  </p>
  <p>
    Swift also introduces optional types, which handle the absence of a value.
    Optionals say either ‚Äúthere is a value, and it equals x‚Äù or ‚Äúthere isn‚Äôt a value at all‚Äù.
    Using optionals is similar to using nil with pointers in Objective-C, but they work for any type, not just classes.
    Not only are optionals safer and more expressive than nil pointers in Objective-C, they‚Äôre at the heart of many of Swift‚Äôs most powerful features.
  </p>
  <p>
    Swift is a type-safe language, which means the language helps you to be clear about the types of values your code can work with.
    If part of your code requires a String, type safety prevents you from passing it an Int by mistake.
    Likewise, type safety prevents you from accidentally passing an optional String to a piece of code that requires a non-optional String.
    Type safety helps you catch and fix errors as early as possible in the development process.

  <section class="main-section" id="Constant and Variables" style="margin-top:4%;">
    <header><h2>Constant and Variables</header></h2>
    <article>
      <p>
        Constants and variables associate a name (such as maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts or welcomeMessage) with a value of a particular type (such as the number 10 or the string "Hello").
        The value of a constant can‚Äôt be changed once it‚Äôs set, whereas a variable can be set to a different value in the future.
      </p>
<h4 style="margin-top:2%;">Declaring Constants and Variables</h4>
<p>
  Constants and variables must be declared before they‚Äôre used.
  You declare constants with the let keyword and variables with the var keyword.
  Here‚Äôs an example of how constants and variables can be used to track the number of login attempts a user has made:
</p>
<code>1   let maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts = 10
2   var currentLoginAttempt = 0
</code>
<p>This code can be read as:</p>
<p>‚ÄúDeclare a new constant called maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts, and give it a value of 10.
  Then, declare a new variable called currentLoginAttempt, and give it an initial value of 0.‚Äù</p>
  <p>In this example, the maximum number of allowed login attempts is declared as a constant, because the maximum value never changes.
    The current login attempt counter is declared as a variable, because this value must be incremented after each failed login attempt.</p>
    <p>You can declare multiple constants or multiple variables on a single line, separated by commas:</p>
    <code>var x = 0.0, y = 0.0, z = 0.0</code>
    <br>
    <code style="background-color: #FFFFDE;">NOTE
If a stored value in your code won‚Äôt change, always declare it as a constant with the let keyword.
Use variables only for storing values that need to be able to change.</code>
    </article>
  </section>
  <br>
  <section class="main-section" id="Type Annotations">
    <header><h2>Type Annotations</h2></header>
    <article>
      <p>You can provide a type annotation when you declare a constant or variable, to be clear about the kind of values the constant or variable can store.
        Write a type annotation by placing a colon after the constant or variable name, followed by a space, followed by the name of the type to use.
      </p>
      <p>This example provides a type annotation for a variable called welcomeMessage, to indicate that the variable can store String values:</p>
      <code>var welcomeMessage: String</code>
      <br>
      <p>The colon in the declaration means ‚Äú‚Ä¶of type‚Ä¶,‚Äù so the code above can be read as:</p>
      <p>‚ÄúDeclare a variable called welcomeMessage that is of type String.‚Äù</p>
      <p>The phrase ‚Äúof type String‚Äù means ‚Äúcan store any String value.‚Äù
        Think of it as meaning ‚Äúthe type of thing‚Äù (or ‚Äúthe kind of thing‚Äù) that can be stored.</p>
        <p>The welcomeMessage variable can now be set to any string value without error:</p>
        <code>welcomeMessage = "Hello"</code>
        <br>
        <p>You can define multiple related variables of the same type on a single line, separated by commas, with a single type annotation after the final variable name:</p>
        <code>var red, green, blue: Double</code>
        <br>
    </article>
  </section>
  <br>
  <section class="main-section" id="Naming Constants and Variables">
    <header><h2>Naming Constants and Variables</h2></header>
    <article>
      <p>Constant and variable names can contain almost any character, including Unicode characters:</p>
      <code>let œÄ = 3.14159
let ‰Ω†Â•Ω = "‰Ω†Â•Ω‰∏ñÁïå"
let üê∂üêÆ = "dogcow"</code>
<br>
<p>Constant and variable names can‚Äôt contain whitespace characters, mathematical symbols, arrows, private-use Unicode scalar values, or line- and box-drawing characters.
  Nor can they begin with a number, although numbers may be included elsewhere within the name</p>
<p>Once you‚Äôve declared a constant or variable of a certain type, you can‚Äôt declare it again with the same name, or change it to store values of a different type.
  Nor can you change a constant into a variable or a variable into a constant.</p>
  <code style="background-color: #FFFFDE;">NOTE

If you need to give a constant or variable the same name as a reserved Swift keyword,
surround the keyword with backticks (`) when using it as a name.
However, avoid using keywords as names unless you have absolutely no choice.</code>
<br>
<p>You can change the value of an existing variable to another value of a compatible type.
  In this example, the value of friendlyWelcome is changed from "Hello!" to "Bonjour!":</p>
  <code>var friendlyWelcome = "Hello!"
friendlyWelcome = "Bonjour!"
// friendlyWelcome is now "Bonjour!"</code>
<br>
<p>Unlike a variable, the value of a constant can‚Äôt be changed after it‚Äôs set.
  Attempting to do so is reported as an error when your code is compiled:</p>
  <code>let languageName = "Swift"
languageName = "Swift++"
// This is a compile-time error: languageName cannot be changed.</code>
<br>
</article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Printing Constants and Variables">
    <header><h2>Printing Constants and Variables</h2></header>
<p>You can print the current value of a constant or variable with the print(_:separator:terminator:) function:</p>
<code>print(friendlyWelcome)
// Prints "Bonjour!"</code>
<br>
<p>The print(_:separator:terminator:) function is a global function that prints one or more values to an appropriate output.
  In Xcode, for example, the print(_:separator:terminator:) function prints its output in Xcode‚Äôs ‚Äúconsole‚Äù pane.
  The separator and terminator parameter have default values, so you can omit them when you call this function.
  By default, the function terminates the line it prints by adding a line break.
  To print a value without a line break after it, pass an empty string as the terminator‚Äîfor example, print(someValue, terminator: "").
  For information about parameters with default values, see Default Parameter Values.</p>
  <p>Swift uses string interpolation to include the name of a constant or variable as a placeholder in a longer string, and to prompt Swift to replace it with the current value of that constant or variable.
    Wrap the name in parentheses and escape it with a backslash before the opening parenthesis:</p>
    <code>print("The current value of friendlyWelcome is \(friendlyWelcome)")
// Prints "The current value of friendlyWelcome is Bonjour!"</code>
<br>
<code style="background-color: #FFFFDE;">NOTE

All options you can use with string interpolation are described in String Interpolation.</code>

  <br>
  <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
    <header><h2>Comments</h2></header>
    <article>
<p>Use comments to include nonexecutable text in your code, as a note or reminder to yourself.
  Comments are ignored by the Swift compiler when your code is compiled.</p>
  <p>Comments in Swift are very similar to comments in C. Single-line comments begin with two forward-slashes (//):</p>
  <br>
  <code>// This is a comment.</code>
  <br>
  <p>Multiline comments start with a forward-slash followed by an asterisk (/*) and end with an asterisk followed by a forward-slash (*/):</p>
  <code>/* This is also a comment
but is written over multiple lines. */</code>
<br>
<p>Unlike multiline comments in C, multiline comments in Swift can be nested inside other multiline comments.
  You write nested comments by starting a multiline comment block and then starting a second multiline comment within the first block.
  The second block is then closed, followed by the first block:</p>
  <br>
  <code>/* This is the start of the first multiline comment.
 /* This is the second, nested multiline comment. */
This is the end of the first multiline comment. */</code>
<br>
<p>Nested multiline comments enable you to comment out large blocks of code quickly and easily, even if the code already contains multiline comments.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Semicolons">
    <header><h2>Semicolons</h2></header>
    <article>
      <p>Unlike many other languages, Swift doesn‚Äôt require you to write a semicolon (;) after each statement in your code, although you can do so if you wish.
        However, semicolons are required if you want to write multiple separate statements on a single line:</p>
        <br>
        <code>let cat = "üê±"; print(cat)
// Prints "üê±"</code>
<br>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Integers">
    <header><h2>Integers</h2></header>
    <article>
      <p>Integers are whole numbers with no fractional component, such as 42 and -23.
        Integers are either signed (positive, zero, or negative) or unsigned (positive or zero).</p>
        <p>Swift provides signed and unsigned integers in 8, 16, 32, and 64 bit forms.
          These integers follow a naming convention similar to C, in that an 8-bit unsigned integer is of type UInt8, and a 32-bit signed integer is of type Int32.
          Like all types in Swift, these integer types have capitalized names.</p>
          <h4>Integer Bounds</h4>
          <p>You can access the minimum and maximum values of each integer type with its min and max properties:</p>
          <br>
          <code>let minValue = UInt8.min  // minValue is equal to 0, and is of type UInt8
let maxValue = UInt8.max  // maxValue is equal to 255, and is of type UInt8</code>
<br>
<p>The values of these properties are of the appropriate-sized number type (such as UInt8 in the example above) and can therefore be used in expressions alongside other values of the same type.</p>
<h4>Int</h4>
<p>In most cases, you don‚Äôt need to pick a specific size of integer to use in your code.
  Swift provides an additional integer type, Int, which has the same size as the current platform‚Äôs native word size:</p>
  <code>On a 32-bit platform, Int is the same size as Int32.
On a 64-bit platform, Int is the same size as Int64.</code>
<p>Unless you need to work with a specific size of integer, always use Int for integer values in your code.
  This aids code consistency and interoperability.
  Even on 32-bit platforms, Int can store any value between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647, and is large enough for many integer ranges.</p>
  <h4>UInt</h4>
  <p>Swift also provides an unsigned integer type, UInt, which has the same size as the current platform‚Äôs native word size:</p>
  <br>
  <code>On a 32-bit platform, UInt is the same size as UInt32.
On a 64-bit platform, UInt is the same size as UInt64.</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Floating-Point Numbers">
    <header><h2>Floating-Point Numbers</h2></header>
    <article>
    <p>Floating-point numbers are numbers with a fractional component, such as 3.14159, 0.1, and -273.15.</p>
    <p>Floating-point types can represent a much wider range of values than integer types, and can store numbers that are much larger or smaller than can be stored in an Int.
      Swift provides two signed floating-point number types:</p>
      <br>
      <code>Double represents a 64-bit floating-point number.
Float represents a 32-bit floating-point number.</code>
<br>
<code style="background-color: #FFFFDE;">NOTE

Double has a precision of at least 15 decimal digits.
Precision of Float can be as little as 6 decimal digits.
The appropriate floating-point type to use depends
on the nature and range of values you need to work with in your code.
In situations where either type would be appropriate, Double is preferred.</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Type Safety and Type Inference">
    <header><h2>Type Safety and Type Inference</h2></header>
    <article>
  <p>Swift is a type-safe language. A type safe language encourages you to be clear about the types of values your code can work with.
    If part of your code requires a String, you can‚Äôt pass it an Int by mistake.</p>
    <p>Type-checking helps you avoid errors when you‚Äôre working with different types of values. However, this doesn‚Äôt mean that you have to specify the type of every constant and variable that you declare.
      If you don‚Äôt specify the type of value you need, Swift uses type inference to work out the appropriate type.
      Type inference enables a compiler to deduce the type of a particular expression automatically when it compiles your code, simply by examining the values you provide.</p>
      <p>For example, if you assign a literal value of 42 to a new constant without saying what type it is, Swift infers that you want the constant to be an Int, because you have initialized it with a number that looks like an integer:</p>
<br>
<code>let meaningOfLife = 42
// meaningOfLife is inferred to be of type Int</code>
<br>
<p>Likewise, if you don‚Äôt specify a type for a floating-point literal, Swift infers that you want to create a Double:</p>
<br>
<code>let pi = 3.14159
// pi is inferred to be of type Double</code>
<br>
<p>Swift always chooses Double (rather than Float) when inferring the type of floating-point numbers.

If you combine integer and floating-point literals in an expression, a type of Double will be inferred from the context:</p>
<code>let anotherPi = 3 + 0.14159
// anotherPi is also inferred to be of type Double</code>
<br>
<p>The literal value of 3 has no explicit type in and of itself, and so an appropriate output type of Double is inferred from the presence of a floating-point literal as part of the addition.</p>
    </article>
  </section>
  <br>
  <section class="main-section" id="Numeric Literals">
    <header><h2>Numeric Literals</h2></header>
    <article>
      <p>Integer literals can be written as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A decimal number, with no prefix</li>
        <li>A binary number, with a 0b prefix</li>
        <li>An octal number, with a 0o prefix</li>
        <li>A hexadecimal number, with a 0x prefix</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For decimal numbers with an exponent of exp, the base number is multiplied by 10exp:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1.25e2 means 1.25 x 102, or 125.0.</li>
          <li>1.25e-2 means 1.25 x 10-2, or 0.0125.</li>
        </ul>
<p>All of these integer literals have a decimal value of 17:</p>
<br>
<code>let decimalInteger = 17
let binaryInteger = 0b10001       // 17 in binary notation
let octalInteger = 0o21           // 17 in octal notation
let hexadecimalInteger = 0x11     // 17 in hexadecimal notation</code>
<br>
<p>Floating-point literals can be decimal (with no prefix), or hexadecimal (with a 0x prefix).
  They must always have a number (or hexadecimal number) on both sides of the decimal point.
  Decimal floats can also have an optional exponent, indicated by an uppercase or lowercase e; hexadecimal floats must have an exponent, indicated by an uppercase or lowercase p.</p>
<p>Numeric literals can contain extra formatting to make them easier to read.
  Both integers and floats can be padded with extra zeros and can contain underscores to help with readability.
  Neither type of formatting affects the underlying value of the literal:</p>
  <br>
  <code>let paddedDouble = 000123.456
let oneMillion = 1_000_000
let justOverOneMillion = 1_000_000.000_000_1</code>
<br>

  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Numeric Type Conversion">
    <header><h2>Numeric Type Conversion</h2></header>
    <article>
<p>Use the Int type for all general-purpose integer constants and variables in your code, even if they‚Äôre known to be nonnegative.
  Using the default integer type in everyday situations means that integer constants and variables are immediately interoperable in your code and will match the inferred type for integer literal values.</p>
  <p>Use other integer types only when they‚Äôre specifically needed for the task at hand, because of explicitly sized data from an external source, or for performance, memory usage, or other necessary optimization.
    Using explicitly sized types in these situations helps to catch any accidental value overflows and implicitly documents the nature of the data being used.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Integer Conversion</h4>
    <p>The range of numbers that can be stored in an integer constant or variable is different for each numeric type.
      An Int8 constant or variable can store numbers between -128 and 127, whereas a UInt8 constant or variable can store numbers between 0 and 255.
      A number that won‚Äôt fit into a constant or variable of a sized integer type is reported as an error when your code is compiled:</p>
      <br>
      <code>let cannotBeNegative: UInt8 = -1
// UInt8 cannot store negative numbers, and so this will report an error
let tooBig: Int8 = Int8.max + 1
// Int8 cannot store a number larger than its maximum value,
// and so this will also report an error</code>
<br>
<p>Because each numeric type can store a different range of values, you must opt in to numeric type conversion on a case-by-case basis.
  This opt-in approach prevents hidden conversion errors and helps make type conversion intentions explicit in your code.</p>
  <p>To convert one specific number type to another, you initialize a new number of the desired type with the existing value.
    In the example below, the constant twoThousand is of type UInt16, whereas the constant one is of type UInt8.
    They can‚Äôt be added together directly, because they‚Äôre not of the same type.
    Instead, this example calls UInt16(one) to create a new UInt16 initialized with the value of one, and uses this value in place of the original:</p>
    <br>
    <code>let twoThousand: UInt16 = 2_000
let one: UInt8 = 1
let twoThousandAndOne = twoThousand + UInt16(one)</code>
<br>
<p>SomeType(ofInitialValue) is the default way to call the initializer of a Swift type and pass in an initial value.
  Behind the scenes, UInt16 has an initializer that accepts a UInt8 value, and so this initializer is used to make a new UInt16 from an existing UInt8.
  You can‚Äôt pass in any type here, however‚Äîit has to be a type for which UInt16 provides an initializer.
  Extending existing types to provide initializers that accept new types (including your own type definitions) is covered in Extensions.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Type Aliases">
    <header><h2>Type Aliases</h2></header>
    <article>
<p>Type aliases define an alternative name for an existing type. You define type aliases with the typealias keyword.</p>
<p>Type aliases are useful when you want to refer to an existing type by a name that is contextually more appropriate, such as when working with data of a specific size from an external source:</p>
<br>
<code>typealias AudioSample = UInt16</code>
<br>
<p>Once you define a type alias, you can use the alias anywhere you might use the original name:</p>
<br>
<code>var maxAmplitudeFound = AudioSample.min
// maxAmplitudeFound is now 0</code>
<br>
<p>Here, AudioSample is defined as an alias for UInt16.
  Because it‚Äôs an alias, the call to AudioSample.min actually calls UInt16.min, which provides an initial value of 0 for the maxAmplitudeFound variable.</p>
  <br>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Booleans">
    <header><h2>Booleans</h2></header>
    <article>
<p>Swift has a basic Boolean type, called Bool. Boolean values are referred to as logical, because they can only ever be true or false.
  Swift provides two Boolean constant values, true and false:</p>
  <br>
  <code>let orangesAreOrange = true
let turnipsAreDelicious = false</code>
<br>
<p>The types of orangesAreOrange and turnipsAreDelicious have been inferred as Bool from the fact that they were initialized with Boolean literal values.
  As with Int and Double above, you don‚Äôt need to declare constants or variables as Bool if you set them to true or false as soon as you create them.
  Type inference helps make Swift code more concise and readable when it initializes constants or variables with other values whose type is already known.</p>
  <p>Boolean values are particularly useful when you work with conditional statements such as the if statement:</p>
  <br>
  <code>if turnipsAreDelicious {
    print("Mmm, tasty turnips!")
} else {
    print("Eww, turnips are horrible.")
}
// Prints "Eww, turnips are horrible."</code>
<br>
<p>Conditional statements such as the if statement are covered in more detail in Control Flow.</p>
<p>Swift‚Äôs type safety prevents non-Boolean values from being substituted for Bool.
  The following example reports a compile-time error:
</p>
<br>
<code>let i = 1
if i {
    // this example will not compile, and will report an error
}
</code>
      <br>
      <p>However, the alternative example below is valid:</p>
      <br>
      <code>let i = 1
if i == 1 {
    // this example will compile successfully
}  </code>
      <br>
      <p>The result of the i == 1 comparison is of type Bool, and so this second example passes the type-check.
        Comparisons like i == 1 are discussed in Basic Operators.
As with other examples of type safety in Swift, this approach avoids accidental errors and ensures that the intention of a particular section of code is always clear.</p>
